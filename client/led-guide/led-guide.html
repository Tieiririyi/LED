        LED lights</a> 
        
        continue to grow in popularity among automotive enthusiasts, thanks to their impressive specs; 
        <a href = "http://energy.gov/articles/top-8-things-you-didn-t-know-about-leds" target = "_blank">
            LED light bulbs last up to 25 times longer</a> 
        than traditional incandescents, deliver an average of 
        <a href = "http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15471">
        83 lumens of light per Watt</a> 
        of energy used (right now – this is expected to improve to 150 lumens per Watt by 2020) and as worldwide production 
        of LEDs grows, consumer prices continue to drop.</p>
        
        <p>LED lighting technology is also growing rapidly; there are now three major types of LED lights available; 
        DIPs (a.k.a. old-school LEDs), SMDs and COBs. Here’s a brief rundown on the two most common types of LED lights 
        currently in use today – COB LEDs and SMD LEDs.</p>
        
        <h3>SMD LED BASICS</h3>
        <p>Surface mounted device light emitting diodes (SMD LEDs) are 
        the most common type of LED lights right now – these consist of a LED chip 
        that is permanently fused to a printed circuit board, resulting in solid units 
        that can be connected in a simple circuits to create various lighting 
        configurations (including light bulbs and strip LED lights). Up to 3 diodes can 
        be fused onto a single SMD chip – this gives SMD LEDs the ability to output a 
        huge <a href = "http://www.instructables.com/answers/How-do-multi-colored-led-lights-work/" target = "_blank">
        range of colors</a> when a chip is built using blue, red and green diodes 
        (while the old-style DIP LEDs are mono-colored).</p>
        
        <p>SMD LEDs are available in a range of dimensions – tuners might be familiar
        with the two most common sizes, 
        <a href = "https://www.hitlights.com/blog/comparison-and-differences-between-led-technologies-dip-vs-smd-vs-cob-vs-mcob/" target = "_blank">
        SMD 3528 and SMD 5050</a>; those are the two most common sizes used for 12V 
        LED light strips.</p>
        
        <h3>COB LED BASICS</h3>
        <p>COB LED BasicsChip on board light emitting diodes, aka COB LEDs, are the 
        newest type of LED lights to hit the market. Like SMD LEDs, COB LEDs consist 
        of multiple diodes that are soldered directly onto a microchip, however, unlike 
        SMDs, COBs <a href = "https://www.hitlights.com/blog/comparison-and-differences-between-led-technologies-dip-vs-smd-vs-cob-vs-mcob/" target = "_blank">
        typically use 9 or more</a> diodes per chip – this produces a light that 
        like a glowing panel (rather than a bunch of tiny little lights as with SMDs).</p>
        
        <p>COB LEDs do boast a higher lumen-per-watt ratio in comparison to both SMD and 
        DIP LEDs, thanks in part to the fact that COB LEDs use a single circuit and just 
        two contacts, regardless of how many diodes are on each chip.</p>
        
        <p>Because they are relatively cheap to manufacture, consumers can look forward 
        to lower prices on COB LEDs as production of this latest generation of LED lights 
        ramps up.</p>
        
        <h3>WHAT’S BETTER – COB OR SMDS?</h3>
        <p>That all depends on your application. If you’re looking for 
        <a href = "http://www.headlightsquick.com/products/texenon-xb-led-rgb-halos.html" target = "_blank">
        color-changable interior</a>  and/or exterior accent lighting, you’ll need to go 
        with SMD LEDs; if you want the maximum lumens per Watt for a mono-colored light 
        (such as a fog light, headlight or dome light) you might want to check out 
        what’s available in COB LEDs.</p>
